# UserDefaults Tutorial

Hey folks! I learned User defaults to storing user login information. When the application is started, the login page opens. 
After the user information is entered, the user defaults to save the information.  When the application starts again, the first 
screen that opens is the home page. When the Log Out  button on the navigation bar is pressed, the recorded information is deleted 
and the login screen appears when the application is restarted.
